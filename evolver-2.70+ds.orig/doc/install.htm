<h1>Surface Evolver Acquisition and Installation</h1>

This chapter explains how to get and install the Evolver.
Evolver is written to be portable between systems. There
are pre-compiled versions for Windows and Macintosh; source
files and a Makefile are provided for unix/Linux systems.


  The distribution packages for various systems are available from the 
 <a href="http://www.susqu.edu/brakke/evolver/evolver.htm">Evolver homepage</a>.
 Each package also contains documentation and sample datafiles and
 scripts.  The documentation subdirectory is named <code>doc</code>, and
 contains the manual in PDF format, an HTML version of
 the documentation (except for the mathematical parts), and a brief
 unix man page evolver.1.  The HTML
 files are also used by the Evolver help command.
 The samples are in the subdirectory <code>fe</code> (which is the
file extension I use for datafiles; it stands for
 "facet-edge," referring to the internal structure of surfaces
 in the Evolver).

Below are instructions for standard packages:

<li><a href="#windows-version">Microsoft Windows</a>
<li><a href="#macOSX-version">Macintosh OS X</a>
</ul>

<h2>Unix version</h2>

Instructions for installing the Surface Evolver on unix-style systems.
Evolver compiles on 64 bit systems as well as 32 bit systems.
<p>
Quick start:
<br>
1. Download <a href="http://www.susqu.edu/brakke/aux/downloads/evolver-2.70.tar.gz">evolver-2.70.tar.gz</a>. <br>
2. Unpack the Evolver archive.
<br>
3. In the <code>src</code> subdirectory, edit Makefile to uncomment the lines for
   your system.
<br>
4. Run "make".
<br>
5. Test by running "./evolver ../fe/cube.fe"
<p>

Detailed instructions:
<p>
1. The Evolver is distributed in a compressed tar archive
   <a href="http://www.susqu.edu/brakke/aux/downloads/evolver-2.70.tar.gz">evolver-2.70.tar.gz</a>,
   available from http://www.susqu.edu/brakke/evolver. Get this file into a 
   working directory.  The packed archive is about 2MB, unpacks to about 5MB.  
   You will probably need another 3 or 4 MB to compile.  
<p>

2. Uncompress the archive with <pre>
      gunzip evolver-2.70.tar.gz </pre>
   Extract the files with <pre>
      tar xvf evolver.tar  </pre>
   This will unpack into three subdirectories: <code>src</code> (source code),
   <code>doc</code> (the html version of the manual), and <code>fe</code>
   (sample datafiles and scripts).  
   The working directory will also contain a PDF version of the manual,
   and a man page, evolver.1.
<p>

3. Install the man page: copy evolver.1 to some appropriate place on your
   manpath, such as <code class="shortcode">/usr/local/share/man/man1</code>.
  You may have to become root to have permission to do this.
<p>

<a   id="EVOLVERPATH"></a>
4. Set the <code>EVOLVERPATH</code> environment variable: 
   Evolver needs to find the initial 
   datafile and sometimes other files (e.g. command files for the
   <a href="commands.htm#read" class="keyword">read</a> 
   command and the help documentation files). If the named file is not in the 
   current directory, then an  environment variable called 
   <code>EVOLVERPATH</code> will be 
   consulted for a directory search list. The datafile directory and the 
   directory with the HTML documentation files should definitely be included.
   The format is the same as the usual <code>PATH</code> environment variable.  
   Set it up  as usual in your system, in <code>.profile</code> or 
   <code>.login</code> or <code>.cshrc</code> or wherever:
<p>

   Unix C shell:<pre>
     setenv EVOLVERPATH /usr/you/evolver/fe:/usr/you/evolver/doc 
</pre>
<p>
   Bourne shell:  <pre>
     EVOLVERPATH=/usr/you/evolver/fe:/usr/you/evolver/doc
     export EVOLVERPATH 
</pre>
<p>

5. Change to the <code>src</code> subdirectory of your Evolver directory.

<p>
6. Modify Makefile for your system. Makefile begins with sets of macro 
   definitions for various systems.   If your system is listed, remove the 
   comment symbols '#' from start of the appropriate lines. If your system 
   is not there, use the <code>GENERIC</code> lines, or set up your own. If you do define 
   your own, be sure to put a corresponding section in include.h.
<p>

7. In Makefile, edit the <code>CFLAGS</code> line to have the proper options (optimization, 
   floating point option, etc.).
<p>

8. In Makefile, <code>GRAPH</code> should be the name of a screen graphics interface file.  
   Use glutgraph.o if possible; most systems have OpenGL/GLUT graphics now.  
   GLUT graphics uses a separate thread to display graphics, so if you use 
   GLUT, you must put <code class="shortcode">-DPTHREADS</code> 
  in <code>CFLAGS</code> and put 
   <code class="shortcode">-lpthread</code> in <code>GRAPHLIB</code>.
   If not using GLUT, for primitive X windows graphics you can use xgraph.o.  
   For no built-in screen graphics at all you can use nulgraph.o. 
   <code>GRAPHLIB</code> 
   should be the appropriate graphics library plus any other libraries needed.
<p>

9. If you want to use parallel processes on a multiprocessor machine, 
   put <code class="shortcode">-DPTHREADS</code> in <code>CFLAGS</code>
   and put <code class="shortcode">-lpthread</code>  
   in <code>GRAPHLIB</code>. Currently, the
   only calculations done in parallel are basic energies and named quantities.
   The number of processes actually done in parallel can be controlled
   with the <span class="nobr"><code>-p</code> <em>n</em></span>
   command line option.
<p>

10. If you want Evolver to be able to use geomview, 
    include <code class="shortcode">-DOOGL</code> in <code>CFLAGS</code>.
<p>

11. If you want Evolver to operate in a higher space dimension than the
    the default maximum of 4, include 
    <span class="nobr"><code>-DMAXCOORD=</code><em>n</em></span> 
    in <code>CFLAGS</code>, 
    where <em>n</em> is
    the maximum space dimension. This sets the upper limit of dimensionality, 
    and is used for allocating space in data structures. 
<p>

12. If your system supports the long double data type, you can compute and
    print values in higher precision by compiling with 
    <code class="shortcode">-DLONGDOUBLE</code> in <code>CFLAGS</code>. 
    But this slows computations somewhat, and should be used only by precision
    fanatics. And on Intel chips, it only does 80 bit precision, even if it
    allocates 128 bits of storage, since that is the hardware precision of 
    the 8087 math coprocessor.  For 128 bit precision (in software, so 
    much slower), compile with -DFLOAT128 and link with the quadmath
    library (which you have to find on your own).
<p>
<a   id="metis-install"></a>
13. If you wish to use the commands based on the METIS partitioning
    software (<a href="commands.htm#metis" class="keyword">metis</a>, 
    <a href="commands.htm#metis" class="keyword">kmetis</a>, 
    <a href="commands.htm#metis" class="keyword">body_metis</a>, and 
    <a href="toggle.htm#metis_factor" class="keyword">metis_factor</a>), then
    you should download the METIS package from,
    <code><a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/">
      http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/</a></code>
    and "make" the library <code>libmetis.a</code>
    (on some systems, make complains it
    cannot find ranlib, but the resulting <code>libmetis.a</code> still works).
    In Evolver's <code>Makefile</code>, add 
    <code class="shortcode">-DMETIS</code>
    to <code>CFLAGS</code>, and 
    add <code class="shortcode">-lmetis</code> to <code>GRAPHLIB</code>. 
    You will probably also have to add 
    <code class="shortcode">-L metispath</code>
    to <code>GRAPHLIB</code> to tell
    the linker where to find libmetis.a.  Note that METIS is incorporated
    in the Windows executable.  If you are using 
    <a href="commands.htm#hessian-command" class="keyword">hessian</a>
    commands on very 
    large surfaces, then 
    <a href="toggle.htm#metis_factor" class="keyword">metis_factor</a>
    can be much faster than the other 
    sparse matrix factoring schemes in Evolver, and I highly recommend it.
<p>

14. From the shell command prompt in the <code>src</code> directory, run "make".  
    This will produce the Evolver executable file named "evolver" in the 
    <code>src</code>
    directory.  If there are errors, hopefully you will only have to change 
    the system-specific parts of Makefile and include.h to get things to work.  
    If significant changes to other files are needed, let me know at
    brakke@susqu.edu.
<p>

15. Copy the evolver executable to someplace on your <code>PATH</code>, such as
    <code class="shortcode">$HOME/bin</code> 
    or <code class="shortcode">/usr/local/bin</code>, 
    or make a link someplace on your <code>PATH</code> to 
    the evolver executable.
<p>
 
16. Test by opening a new shell and running "evolver cube".  Now you
    should be able to follow the tutorials in the HTML manual
    or the printed manual.

<p>

<p>
<a   id="geomview-install"></a><h4>Installing geomview</h4>
If your system does not have OpenGL/GLUT, I suggest you
get it (the freeglut developer package, for instance).
Otherwise you might get the 
<a href="http://www.geomview.org/download/">
geomview package</a> from The Geometry
Center. There are pre-compiled binaries for many unix systems here.
Follow geomview's installation directions, and make sure that geomview
is accessible through your <code>PATH</code>.  NOTE: The X windows versions
of geomview seem to require some event to occur in the geomview display
window  before it will redraw after loading a new datafile.  So if 
geomview seems hung, just run the mouse over the window to give it an
event to wake it up.


<hr><a   id="windows-version"></a>
<h2>Microsoft Windows version</h2>

 The distributions available here include both the 32-bit version of Evolver
 (evolver.exe) and the 64-bit version (evolver64.exe).  The 64-bit version
 is meant for very large models (hundreds of thousands of facets).  Unless
 you have such a large surface, use the 32-bit version since it is 10 to 20
 percent faster, having less data to move around.
<p>
 There are now two alternative ways to install Evolver:
 
 <h3>I. Download <a href="http://www.susqu.edu/brakke/aux/downloads/Evolver-2.70-Win32.msi">
 <code>Evolver-2.70-Win32.msi</code></a>   and run it.</h3>
 This is an installation program that will lead you through all steps 
 and options in the installation procedure.  It will
 automatically set up the environment variables described below and 
 copy files to folders. Puts the Evolver executables on your PATH, and
 associates the .fe extension with Evolver, so clicking on a datafile
 launches it. Includes both the 32-bit version (evolver.exe) and the
 64-bit version (evolver64.exe).
 <p>
 <h3>II. Download 
 <a href="http://www.susqu.edu/brakke/aux/downloads/evolver2.70-Win32.zip">
 <code>evolver2.70-Win32.zip</code></a>.</h3> 
 For an old-fashioned do-it-yourself installation, this file
 has the executable files evolver.exe and evolver64.exe
 along with the documentation and sample
 datafile subdirectories.  Steps to follow after downloading:
 <ol>
 <li> Create a directory (such as <code>C:\evolver</code>),
 and unzip the distribution package there. 
 <li> Add your installation directory ro your <code>PATH</code>
  (Control Panel/System/Advanced System Settings/Environment
    Variables/System Variables/PATH/Edit)
 or you can copy evolver.exe
 to someplace in your <code>PATH</code>, such as <code>C:\windows\system32</code>.
 <li>
 <a   id="EVOLVERPATH-(Windows)"></a>
 You should
 also create an environment variable <code>EVOLVERPATH</code> telling Evolver where
 to search for various files.  Do this by opening
 Control Panel/System/Advanced/Environment Variables, clicking New
 under System Variables, entering <code>EVOLVERPATH</code> for the Variable name,
 and <code>c:\evolver\fe;c:\evolver\doc</code> for the Variable value.  You may
 add further paths of your own to this list if you wish.
 <li>To make Evolver start automatically when you click on a *.fe file,
 you can associate Evolver with the file extension .fe by opening
 My Computer/Tools/Folder Options/File Types/New, entering the
 File Extension fe, clicking OK, clicking Change, and browsing
 for the evolver.exe program. (This sequence of actions may vary
 on different Windows versions.)
</ol>
<p>
 The Windows version
 uses OpenGL/GLUT graphics.  OpenGL is standard in Windows, and
 all the necessary GLUT components are included in the executable,
 so you don't have to install anything.

<a   id="macOSX-version"></a>
<h2>Macintosh OSX version</h2>

 I am not a Mac person, and the Mac OSX version is just a port
 of the unix version, so there are no Mac bells and whistles.
<p>
 Quick start: <br>
 1.  Download
 <a href="http://www.susqu.edu/brakke/aux/downloads/Evolver270-OSX.tar.gz">
 Evolver270-OSX.tar.gz</a>.
 <br>
 2. Open the Evolver270-OSX folder and double-click on the evolver file.
 <br>
 3. Evolver prompts for a file; tell it fe/cube
 <br>
 4. You should now be able to follow the tutorial in the manual.
 <br>
 <p>
 Detailed instructions: <p>
 1.  Download
 <a href="http://www.susqu.edu/brakke/aux/downloads/Evolver270-OSX.tar.gz">
 Evolver270-OSX.tar.gz</a>.
 <p>
 2. The download probably created a folder Evolver270-OSX on your
 desktop.  This folder really has a unix path something like
 /Users/yourname/Evolver270-OSX.  These notes will mostly refer
 to the terminal command line, so you should be able to open a
 terminal and use a command line prompt.
<p>
 3. The Evolver270-OSX folder has the executable file evolver, the
 samples folder fe, the documentation folder doc, a PDF version
 of the manual, and a man page evolver.1.  
<p>
 4. Move the executable to some place on your <code>PATH</code>, e.g.
 <pre>   cp evolver /Users/yourname/bin </pre>
 or add the Evolver folder to your <code>PATH</code>. 
 <p>
 5.
 You should also create an environment variable <code>EVOLVERPATH</code> 
 containing paths to the <code>fe</code> and <code>doc</code> folders by
 placing the following line in your shell initialization file, with
 appropriate modifications.  You can tell which shell you are running
 by running the ps command at the command prompt.
 <p> C Shell (csh, tcsh): put the following in /Users/yourname/.cshrc or
  /Users/yourname/.tcshrc:
 <pre> setenv EVOLVERPATH /Users/yourname/Evolver270-OSX/fe:/Users/yourname/Evolver270-OSX/doc </pre>
   Bourne shell (sh,bash): put the following in /Users/yourname/.profile
  or /Users/yourname/.bashrc:  <pre>
     EVOLVERPATH=/usr/you/evolver/fe:/usr/you/evolver/doc
     export EVOLVERPATH </pre>
<p>
  6. Install the man page by copying evolver.1 to some place on your
  manpath, e.g. <pre>
     cp evolver.1 /usr/share/man/man1 </pre>
  You may have to become root to have permission to do this.
<p>
  7. Test by opening a new shell and running "evolver cube".  Now you
 should be able to follow the tutorials in the HTML manual or printed
 manual.
<p>
  8. If you wish to compile your own version of the Evolver, and have
  a C compiler, then follow the <a href="#unix-version">unix instructions</a>.
